Alright, so I’m deep into building Kiko Network. The main focus is decentralized weather and air data, but I’m trying to figure out how to really monetize that data. Selling it to fleets seems like a solid start—think logistics companies, delivery services, or public transport. They’d definitely want real-time weather and air quality to optimize routes, avoid delays, and maybe even manage their vehicle health. 


The question is, how do I package this in a way that fleets actually care about? They probably don’t want raw data, so it’s going to have to be more like an API they can plug into, something that helps them react to the data in real-time. Maybe a dashboard that alerts them to things like fog or high pollution levels? That could work.
